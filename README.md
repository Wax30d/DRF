# Django Rest framework.

DRF made it so easy for us to serialize data.

The serializers not only take our models and transmit them as JSON objects. 
They also provide data from users to the backend. 
They automatically clean the data or validate data. 
This is a plus from DRF. 
Cleaned data removes all the security issues.
